### Welcome to my Qubes repo for new installation config, commands, sample files, and useful scripts
- Quickly change DPI / scaling_factor inside qubes (changes the "total zoom"). 
- Config recommendations for templates, repos, browsers, VPNs, odds and ends.
- Useful terminal commands so you dont have to look them up.

### i3wm Integration and Useful Scripts
- Auto generate keybindings for all possible qubes/command pairs with a simple config file
- Sample xorg.conf and instructions for multiple monitor setup with i3wm
- Keybindings to launch terminal, file manager, or run arbitrary command inside qubes

*d-menu is nice, but you'll run circles around it with these automated keybindings*

### Automatic Install

### Manual Install
It's a good bit of work but at least you can pick and choose.

Welcome to my repo for Qubes related setup ideas, configs, scripts, and links. 

### SCRIPTS, CONFIG RECOMMENDATIONS, SAMPLE FILES
- Script that screenshots a window from *inside* a VM and saves inside the VM.
- Script to quickly change DPI inside VMs (basically changes the zoom of windows in a VM). 
- Recommendations on configurations. Fedora repos, browsers config, VPNs, odds and ends.

### I3WM INTEGRATION AND USEFUL SCRIPTS:
- Auto generate keybindings for all possible VM/command pairs with a simple config file
- Sample xorg.conf and instructions for multiple monitor setup with i3wm
- Keybindings to launch terminal, file manager, or run arbitrary command inside VMs
*d-menu is nice, but you'll run circles around it with these automated keybindings*

### AUTOMATIC INSTALL

### MANUAL INSTALL
It's a good bit of work but at least you can pick and choose.

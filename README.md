Welcome to my repo for Qubes related setup ideas, configs, scripts, and links. 

### SCRIPTS, CONFIG RECOMMENDATIONS, SAMPLE FILES
- Script that screenshots a window from *inside* a qube and saves inside the qube.
- Script to quickly change DPI inside qubes (DPI basically changes the "total zoom"). 
- Config recommendations with terminal commands. repos, browsers, VPNs, odds and ends.

### I3WM INTEGRATION AND USEFUL SCRIPTS:
- Auto generate keybindings for all possible qubes/command pairs with a simple config file
- Sample xorg.conf and instructions for multiple monitor setup with i3wm
- Keybindings to launch terminal, file manager, or run arbitrary command inside qubes

*d-menu is nice, but you'll run circles around it with these automated keybindings*

### AUTOMATIC INSTALL

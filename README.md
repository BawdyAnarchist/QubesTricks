Welcome to my repo for some useful scripts and personal notes on Qubes. 

Start with the Qubes directory for some ideas on system configuration, tips, and a couple scripts. 

Next, if you're taking the time to learn/run Qubes, you'll be well served by running i3wm instead of xfce. The workflow is better/faster, and it just makes sense, given the multiple VMs you're dealing with.    
- There's a script for auto-generating key bindings for all possible VM/command pairs     
- Whether you're new to Qubes + i3 or a veteran, you'll find this script a big timesaver   
   - If you're a *"thank god for the d-menu"* kind of person; you definitely need these scripts.

**LET ME SAVE YOU LOADS OF TIME/EFFORT ON i3 KEYBINDINGS**

Whether you're a brand new i3 user, or veteran, you're likely to find this part of my repo super useful.  It enables you to quickly/easily bindsym every combination of VM-command you might ever want.  You will find two documentation files in this directory, \`i3TIPS.md' and \`HOWTO.md' 

**i3TIPS.md**
Provides some good config options to add, things you'll probably want from i3, as well as pointing out a bug or two.  It's better to do this early in a fresh install, as navigating the OS becomes easier from the get-go.  If you're new to i3, definitely give this a read.

**HOWTO.md**
Documentation on how to use the i3gen script.  It's f#king amazing, especially if used in conjuction with some of my other i3-inspired scripts.  Cool shit like a script+keybind to take a screenshot of a selected window ***from within the VM itself, and save it there.***  Cool shit like *autogeneration* of ALL your VM specific keybinds, with one simple setup file.  

For example, I have 32 VMs, each with 5-15 commands, requiring 500 extra lines in the i3 config to fully map out all mode-keybind-VM-command combinations.  Imagine trying to hand crank that, much less add new VMs and commands, or god forbid you want to re-arrange keybinds.  This script enables all of that, practically on the fly.  
- **If you're a *"thank god for the d-menu"* kind of person, you REALLY need this script.**

Due to the rampant proliferation of bad philosophy, mediated in no small part, by 
modern day priests and pharisees, also known as lawyers, judges, politicians, et al,
and in general, self-proclaimed "authorities;" scribbles have been placed in this 
document titled "LICENSE" (in quotation marks to signify satire), as it is a common
location for information and/or [often false] claims regarding the use of SPEECH.

***************************************************************************************

This repository (like all repositories) is first and foremost, speech.  That speech
may contain logic and arguments of various types, commonly referred to as "code" or
"software". It also contains opinions, observations, and conditional recommendations.   

As is the case with virtually all speech released into the general realm of humanity,
those who encounter said speech, humanity in general, has the inherent Right to copy, 
modify, use, distribute, and sell; without encumberance, obligation, or prohibition.

I/We, release this speech, for the benefit of humanity, into the general realm of 
humanity, the world at large, sometimes referred to as "the public," absent any 
claim of encumberance, obligation, or prohibition, to or from anyone.

I/We release this speech, provided "AS IS", providing absolutely no promises OR 
warranties OR assurances regarding said speech.  Further, there is no guarantee or 
promise regarding: Reliability, accuracy, integrity, suitability, or non-infringement. 

As such, there is no basis for any claim of liability against the author(s) for any 
damage arising from, in connection with the use of, or in association with, this speech.

At the point that speech flies free into the world at large, no one has the right to 
prohibit humanity against its usage, or impose on individuals, fictional claims like 
so-called licenses, copyrights, or patents, absent some clear and valid contract.

So do whatever the fuck you want with it. Do your own evaluation, use at your own risk. 
You are 100% reponsible for your own use of speech contained in this repository. 

These things would be true regardless of whatever fictions, pre-conditions, claims,
encumbrances, or obligations I might scribble in some farcical speech called "LICENSE"
